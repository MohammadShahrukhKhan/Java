Java does not have "Desctructor" because it has garbage collector

POLYMORPHISM - Doing the same job in different ways in JAVA is said to be POLYMORPHISM.
Types:
1. Function Overloading (Compile Type) - Creating different functions of same name i.e. 
functions performing different tasks having same name.
2. Function Overriding (Run Type)


INHERITANCE:
There are four kinds of INHERITANCE
1. Single Level Inheritance - one base class and one derived class.
2. Multi level - one base class and multiple latter derived classes.
3. Heirarchiel level - Multiple derived classes inherit the same(single) base class.
4. Hybrid level - Hybrid inheritance in Java is a combination of two or more types of inheritances. 
The purpose of using hybrid inheritance in Java is to modularize the codebase into well-defined classes 
and provide code reusability.

ACCESS MODIFIERS:

1.Public - This information can be accessed by anybody and can be accessed in a different package by anyone.
2.Private - can only be accessed within the class and not outside the class.
3.Protected - only the sub classes of different packages can access.
4.Default - Every parameter or function is Default by default unless something is added before it, it can be accessed
by all in the same package but not by the other packages.
